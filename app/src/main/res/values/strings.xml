            There was once a powerful king who was married to seven queens. The king was a good ruler and a generous man, but he had no heir to his throne and this made him very sad.

One day, the youngest and most beautiful of the king’s wives became pregnant. The king was overjoyed at this news and there was much celebrating.

The older wives became more and more jealous of the young queen as their husband, the king, began to pay her more and more attention and bestow upon her lavish gifts and affection.

When the day finally arrived, the youngest queen did not give birth to just one child, but instead gave birth to eight beautiful babies: seven handsome boys and one beautiful girl.

The jealous queens, unable to have children of their own, hatched an unspeakable plan when they learned of the birth of the eight children. During the night, before the poor king had a chance to see his sons and his daughter, the queens stole each child, killed them and buried them in the palace gardens where they would never be found.

Then the jealous queens replaced each boy with a puppy dog, and the baby girl they replaced with a small kitten. Then they called for the king to come quickly to the youngest queen’s chambers.

‘You see she has given birth to animals,’ said the first wife.

‘This is surely witchcraft,’ said another. ‘You must banish your youngest wife from our kingdom.’

Although the youngest queen protested her innocence to the king, she was still banished from the kingdom and forced to live in exile, never knowing what had happened to her beloved children.

The years passed until, one warm spring, something very strange happened. From the earth where the wicked queens had buried the eight children, there grew seven Champa trees and one Parul tree; beautiful and colourful and rich in aroma.

When the wicked queens approached the trees and tried to pluck the beautiful flowers, the branches lifted higher into the air out of reach. When the king approached and tried to pluck the flowers, the branches moved again so that the flowers remained on the tree.

Then a soft voice drifted on the scented breeze. ‘Bring the banished queen to us and see if she can pluck our flowers.’

The king ordered his most trusted guards to fetch the banished queen and return her to the palace.

Upon her return, the young queen was asked by the king to approach the mysterious trees and try to pluck the flowers from the branches. When she reached up and plucked a flower from the first Champa tree, a baby boy emerged from the flower and was reunited with his mother. The same thing happened with the second Champa tree and the third, until all seven baby boys were reunited with their mother. And when the queen reached up and plucked the flower from the Parul tree, a beautiful baby girl emerged from the flower and embraced her mother once more.

The king was overjoyed to see his family reunited at last and asked his wife to forgive him and to return to the palace forever.

The king also learned that the older queens had been responsible for the evil plot to separate him from his youngest wife and his eight children. He immediately ordered that each wife be imprisoned for life and never spoken of again.

After the evil queens were imprisoned, the youngest queen and the king lived happily ever after with their eight beautiful children who all grew up to be strong and healthy. This story quickly spread throughout the kingdom and the people learned that no good can ever come of envy or of wrongdoing.

        In a town in Persia there lived two brothers, one named Cassim, the other Ali Baba. Cassim was married to a rich wife and lived in luxury, while Ali Baba had to maintain his wife and children by cutting wood in a neighbouring forest and selling it in the town. One day, when Ali Baba was in the forest, he saw a troop of men on horseback, coming toward him in a cloud of dust. He was afraid they were robbers, and climbed into a tree for safety. When they came up to him and dismounted, he counted forty of them.


This story from 1001 Nights is not without bloodshed, but all the same, children will love its exciting plot. The name of Ali Baba will forever be associated with thieves, perhaps unfairly as Ali only steals from robbers. The true hero turns out to be a woman – Morgiana, the slave-girl.

At a shade under half an hour, this is a longer story than we usual publish – and we have an introduction from the pond where Bertie lives.

In a town in Persia there dwelled two brothers, one named Cassim, the other Ali Baba. Cassim was married to a rich wife and lived in plenty; while Ali Baba had to maintain his wife and children by cutting wood in a neighbouring forest and selling it in the town. One day, when Ali Baba was in the forest, he saw a troop of men on horseback, coming toward him in a cloud of dust. He was afraid they were robbers, and climbed into a tree for safety. When they came up to him and dismounted, he counted forty of them. They unbridled their horses and tied them to trees. The finest man among them, whom Ali Baba took to be their captain, went a little way among some bushes, and said: “Open Sesame!” so plainly that Ali Baba heard him. A door opened in the rocks, and having made the troop go in, he followed them, and the door shut again of itself. They stayed some time inside, and Ali Baba, fearing they might come out and catch him, was forced to sit patiently in the tree. At last the door opened again, and the forty thieves came out. As the captain went in last, he came out first, and made them all pass by him. He then closed the door, saying, “Shut Sesame!” Every man bridled his horse and mounted. The captain put himself at their head, and they returned as they came.

Then Ali Baba climbed down and went to the door concealed among the bushes, and said: “Open Sesame!” It flew open. Ali Baba, who expected a dull, dismal place, was greatly surprised to find it large and well lighted, hollowed by the hand of man in the form of a vault, which received the light from an opening in the ceiling. He saw rich bales of merchandise – silk brocades, all piled together, and gold and silver in heaps, and money in leather purses. He went in and the door shut behind him. He did not look at the silver, but brought out as many bags of gold as he thought his asses, which were browsing outside, could carry. He loaded them with the bags, and hid it all with fagots. Using the words: “Shut Sesame!” he closed the door and went home.

Then he drove his asses into the yard, shut the gates, carried the money-bags to his wife, and emptied them out before her. He bade her to keep the secret, and he would go and bury the gold. “Let me first measure it,” said his wife. “I will go and borrow a measure off someone, while you dig the hole.” So she ran to the wife of Cassim and borrowed a measure. Knowing Ali Baba’s poverty, the sister was curious to find out what sort of grain his wife wished to measure, and artfully put some suet at the bottom of the measure. Ali Baba’s wife went home and set the measure on the heap of gold, and filled it and emptied it often, to her great content. She then carried it back to her sister, without noticing that a piece of gold was sticking to it, which Cassim’s wife perceived directly whilst her back was turned. She grew very curious, and said to Cassim when he came home: “Cassim, your brother is richer than you. He does not count his money, he measures it.” He begged her to explain this riddle, which she did by showing him the piece of money and telling him where she found it. Then Cassim grew so envious that he could not sleep, and went to his brother in the morning before sunrise. “Ali Baba,” he said, showing him the gold piece, “you pretend to be poor and yet you measure gold.” By this Ali Baba perceived that through his wife’s folly Cassim and his wife knew their secret, so he confessed all and offered Cassim a share. “That I expect,” said Cassim, “but I must know where to find the treasure, otherwise I will discover all, and you will lose all.” Ali Baba, more out of kindness than fear, told him of the cave, and the very words to use. Cassim left Ali Baba, meaning to be beforehand with him and get the treasure for himself. He rose early next morning, and set out with ten mules loaded with great chests. He soon found the place, and the door in the rock. He said: “Open Sesame!” and the door opened and shut behind him. He could have feasted his eyes all day on the treasures, but he now hastened to gather together as much of it as possible; but when he was ready to go he could not remember what to say for thinking of his great riches. Instead of “Sesame,” he said: “Open Barley!” and the door remained fast. He named several different sorts of grain, all but the right one, and the door still stuck fast. He was so frightened at the danger he was in that he had as much forgotten the word as if he had never heard it.

About noon the robbers returned to their cave, and saw Cassim’s mules roving about with great chests on their backs. This gave them the alarm; they drew their sabres, and went to the door, which opened on their Captain’s saying: “Open Sesame!” Cassim, who had heard the trampling of their horses’ feet, resolved to sell his life dearly, so when the door opened he leaped out and threw the Captain down. In vain, however, for the robbers with their sabres soon killed him. On entering the cave they saw all the bags laid ready, and could not imagine how anyone had got in without knowing their secret. They cut Cassim’s body into four quarters, and nailed them up inside the cave, in order to frighten anyone who should venture in, and went away in search of more treasure.

As night drew on Cassim’s wife grew very uneasy, and ran to her brother-in-law, and told him where her husband had gone. Ali Baba did his best to comfort her, and set out to the forest in search of Cassim. The first thing he saw on entering the cave was his dead brother. Full of horror, he put the body on one of his asses, and bags of gold on the other two, and, covering all with some fagots, returned home. He drove the two asses laden with gold into his own yard, and led the other to Cassim’s house. The door was opened by the slave Morgiana, whom he knew to be both brave and cunning. Unloading the ass, he said to her: “This is the body of your master, who has been murdered, but whom we must bury as though he had died in his bed. I will speak with you again, but now tell your mistress I am come.” The wife of Cassim, on learning the fate of her husband, broke out into cries and tears, but Ali Baba offered to take her to live with him and his wife if she would promise to keep his counsel and leave everything to Morgiana; whereupon she agreed, and dried her eyes.

Morgiana, meanwhile, sought an apothecary and asked him for some lozenges. “My poor master,” she said, “can neither eat nor speak, and no one knows what his distemper is.” She carried home the lozenges and returned next day weeping, and asked for an essence only given to those just about to die. Thus, in the evening, no one was surprised to hear the wretched shrieks and cries of Cassim’s wife and Morgiana, telling everyone that Cassim was dead. The day after, Morgiana went to an old cobbler near the gates of the town who opened his stall early, put a piece of gold in his hand, and bade him to follow her with his needle and thread. Having bound his eyes with a handkerchief, she took him to the room where the body lay, pulled off the bandage, and bade him to sew the quarters together, after which she covered his eyes again and led him home. Then they buried Cassim, and Morgiana his slave followed him to the grave, weeping and tearing her hair, while Cassim’s wife stayed at home uttering lamentable cries. Next day she went to live with Ali Baba, who gave Cassim’s shop to his eldest son.

The Forty Thieves, on their return to the cave, were much astonished to find Cassim’s body gone and some of their money-bags. “We are certainly discovered,” said the Captain, “and shall be undone if we cannot find out who it is that knows our secret. Two men must have known it; we have killed one, we must now find the other. To this end one of you who is bold and artful must go into the city dressed as a traveller, and discover whom we have killed, and whether men talk of the strange manner of his death. If the messenger fails he must lose his life, lest we be betrayed.” One of the thieves started up and offered to do this, and after the rest had highly commended him for his bravery he disguised himself, and happened to enter the town at daybreak, just by Baba Mustapha’s stall. The thief bade him good-day, saying: “Honest man, how can you possibly see to stitch at your age?” “Old as I am,” replied the cobbler, “I have very good eyes, and will you believe me when I tell you that I sewed a dead body together in a place where I had less light than I have now.” The robber was overjoyed at his good fortune, and, giving him a piece of gold, desired to be shown the house where he stitched up the dead body. At first Mustapha refused, saying that he had been blindfolded; but when the robber gave him another piece of gold he began to think he might remember the turnings if blindfolded as before. This means he succeeded; the robber partly led him, and was partly guided by him, right in front of Cassim’s house, the door of which the robber marked with a piece of chalk. Then, well pleased, he bade farewell to Baba Mustapha and returned to the forest. By and by Morgiana, going out, saw the mark the robber had made, quickly guessed that some mischief was brewing, and fetching a piece of chalk marked two or three doors on each side, without saying anything to her master or mistress.

The thief,  in the meantime, told his comrades of his discovery. The Captain thanked him, and bade him to show him the house he had marked. But when they came to it they saw that five or six of the houses were chalked in the same manner. The guide was so confounded that he knew not what answer to make, and when they returned he was at once beheaded for having failed. Another robber was dispatched, and, having won over Baba Mustapha, marked the house in red chalk; but Morgiana being again too clever for them, the second messenger was put to death also. The Captain now resolved to go himself, but, wiser than the others, he did not mark the house, but looked at it so closely that he could not fail to remember it. He returned, and ordered his men to go into the neighbouring villages and buy nineteen mules, and thirty-eight leather jars, all empty except one, which was full of oil. The Captain put one of his men, fully armed, into each, rubbing the outside of the jars with oil from the full vessel. Then the nineteen mules were loaded with thirty-seven robbers in jars, and the jar of oil, and reached the town by dusk. The Captain stopped his mules in front of Ali Baba’s house, and said to Ali Baba, who was sitting outside for coolness: “I have brought some oil from a distance to sell at tomorrow’s market, but it is now so late that I know not where to pass the night, unless you will do me the favour to take me in.” Though Ali Baba had seen the Captain of the robbers in the forest, he did not recognize him in the disguise of an oil merchant. He bade him welcome, opened his gates for the mules to enter, and went to Morgiana to bid her to prepare a bed and supper for his guest. He brought the stranger into his hall, and after they had supped went again to speak to Morgiana in the kitchen, while the Captain went into the yard under pretence of seeing after his mules, but really to tell his men what to do. Beginning at the first jar and ending at the last, he said to each man: “As soon as I throw some stones from the window of the chamber where I lie, cut the jars open with your knives and come out, and I will be with you in a trice.” He returned to the house, and Morgiana led him to his chamber. She then told Abdallah, her fellow-slave, to set on the pot to make some broth for her master, who had gone to bed. Meanwhile her lamp went out, and she had no more oil in the house. “Do not be uneasy,” said Abdallah: “go into the yard and take some out of one of those jars.” Morgiana thanked him for his advice, took the oil pot, and went into the yard. When she came to the first jar the robber inside said softly: “Is it time?”

Any other slave but Morgiana, on finding a man in the jar instead of the oil she wanted, would have screamed and made a noise; but she, knowing the danger her master was in, bethought herself of a plan, and answered quietly: “Not yet, but presently.” She went to all the jars, giving the same answer, till she came to the jar of oil. She now saw that her master, thinking to entertain an oil merchant, had let thirty-eight robbers into his house. She filled her oil pot, went back to the kitchen, and, having lit her lamp, went again to the oil jar and filled a large kettle full of oil. When it boiled she went and poured enough oil into every jar to stifle and kill the robber inside. When this brave deed was done she went back to the kitchen, put out the fire and the lamp, and waited to see what would happen.

In a quarter of an hour the Captain of the robbers awoke, got up, and opened the window. As all seemed quiet, he threw down some little pebbles which hit the jars. He listened, and as none of his men seemed to stir he grew uneasy, and went down into the yard. On going to the first jar and saying: “Are you asleep?” he smelt the hot boiled oil, and knew at once that his plot to murder Ali Baba and his household had been discovered. He found all the gang was dead, and, missing the oil out of the last jar, became aware of the manner of their death. He then forced the lock of a door leading into a garden, and climbing over several walls made his escape. Morgiana heard and saw all this, and, rejoicing at her success, went to bed and fell asleep.

At daybreak Ali Baba arose, and, seeing the oil jars still there, asked why the merchant had not gone with his mules. Morgiana bade him look in the first jar and see if there was any oil. Seeing a man, he started back in terror. “Have no fear,” said Morgiana; “the man cannot harm you: he is dead.” Ali Baba, when he had recovered somewhat from his astonishment, asked what had become of the merchant. “Merchant!” said she, “he is no more a merchant than I am!” and she told him the whole story, assuring him that it was a plot of the robbers of the forest, of whom only three were left, and that the white and red chalk marks had something to do with it. Ali Baba at once gave Morgiana her freedom, saying that he owed her his life. They then buried the bodies in Ali Baba’s garden, while the mules were sold in the market by his slaves.

The Captain returned to his lonely cave, which seemed frightful to him without his lost companions, and firmly resolved to avenge them by killing Ali Baba. He dressed himself carefully, and went into the town, where he took lodgings in an inn. In the course of a great many journeys to the forest he carried away many rich stuffs and much fine linen, and set up a shop opposite that of Ali Baba’s son. He called himself Cogia Hassan, and as he was both civil and well dressed he soon made friends with Ali Baba’s son, and through him with Ali Baba, whom he was continually asking to sup with him. Ali Baba, wishing to return his kindness, invited him into his house and received him smiling, thanking him for his kindness to his son. When the merchant was about to take his leave, Ali Baba stopped him, saying: “Where are you going, sir, in such haste? Will you not stay and sup with me?” The merchant refused, saying that he had a reason; and on Ali Baba’s asking him what that was, he replied: “It is sir, that I can eat no victuals that have any salt in them.” “If that is all,” said Ali Baba, “let me tell you that there shall be no salt in either the meat or the bread that we eat tonight.” He went to give this order to Morgiana, who was much surprised. “Who is this man?” she said, “who eats no salt with his meat?” “He is an honest man, Morgiana,” returned her master, “therefore do as I bid you.” But she could not withstand a desire to see this strange man, so she helped Abdallah to carry up the dishes, and saw in a moment that Cogia Hassan was the robber Captain, and carried a dagger under his garment. “I am not surprised,” she said to herself, “that this wicked man, who intends to kill my master, will eat no salt with him, but I will hinder his plans.”

She sent up the supper by Abdallah, while she made ready for one of the boldest acts that could be thought on. When the dessert had been served, Cogia Hassan was left alone with Ali Baba and his son, whom he thought to make drunk and then to murder them. Morgiana, meanwhile, put on a head-dress like a dancing-girl’s, and clasped a girdle round her waist, from which hung a dagger with a silver hilt, and said to Abdallah: “Take your tabor, and let us go and divert our master and his guest.” Abdallah took his tabor and played before Morgiana until they came to the door, where Abdallah stopped playing and Morgiana made a low courtesy. “Come in, Morgiana,” said Ali Baba, “and let Cogia Hassan see what you can do,” and turning to Cogia Hassan, he said: “She’s my slave and my housekeeper.” Cogia Hassan was by no means pleased, for he feared that his chance of killing Ali Baba was gone for the present, but he pretended great eagerness to see Morgiana, and Abdallah began to play and Morgiana to dance. After she had performed several dances she drew her dagger and made passes with it, sometimes pointing it at her own breast, sometimes at her master’s, as if it were part of the dance. Suddenly, out of breath, she snatched the tabor from Abdallah with her left hand, and, holding the dagger in her right hand, held out the tabor to her master. Ali Baba and his son put a piece of gold into it, and Cogia Hassan, seeing that she was coming to him, pulled out his purse to make her a present, but while he was putting his hand into it Morgiana plunged the dagger into his heart.

“Unhappy girl!” cried Ali Baba and his son, “what have you done to ruin us?”

“It was to preserve you, master, not to ruin you,” answered Morgiana. “See here,” opening the false merchant’s garment and showing the dagger. “See what an enemy you have entertained! Remember, he would eat no salt with you, and what more would you have? Look at him! He is both the false oil merchant and the Captain of the Forty Thieves.”

Ali Baba was so grateful to Morgiana for thus saving his life that he offered her to his son in marriage, who readily consented, and a few days after, the wedding was celebrated with greatest splendor.

At the end of a year Ali Baba, hearing nothing of the two remaining robbers, judged they were dead, and set out to the cave. The door opened on his saying: “Open Sesame!” He went in, and saw that nobody had been there since the Captain left it. He brought away as much gold as he could carry, and returned to town. He told his son the secret of the cave, which his son handed down in his turn, so the children and grandchildren of Ali Baba were rich to the end of their lives.

        Many centuries ago, a nobleman lived in Krakow. His name was Jan Twardowski. He was an educated man, and he loved books and science. He was especially interested in magic and alchemy, but after many years of research, he understood that witchcraft is impossible without using supernatural forces.

One day, Master Twardowski found spells in his library books that would help him contact spirits. He completed the rituals in the books. When he had finished, a tall slim creature appeared in his room. It was the Devil himself. He had small black horns on his head, long sharp claws and hooves instead of feet.

The Devil looked at the man and grinned, revealing his sharp teeth.

“How can I serve you, Master Twardowski?” asked the Devil.

Master Twardowski told the Devil about his research on magic and his wish to make real spells that worked. The Devil assured him that his dreams could soon come true. All Master Twardowski had to do was sign a contract agreeing to give his soul to the Devil.

Master Twardowski knew that the contract was a trap. It would lock him in Hell for eternity.

“Your offer is very generous,” he said to the Devil. “I’ll soon be making a pilgrimage to Rome. You can have my soul as soon as I arrive there.”

The Devil did not object to this addition and was pleased with the prospect of gaining a new soul. He did not know, however, that Twardowski did not intend to visit Rome at all.

Both parties signed the contract. From that moment on, the Devil was bound to serve Master Twardowski in making his magic possible.

The Devil knew that human souls are, after all, selfish and greedy. He expected that Master Twardowski would use his new magical powers for evil purposes. However, to his surprise, Twardowski used magic to do good. He helped people and animals in any way he could. Soon, Master Twardowski became famous across the whole country. One day, the king himself called Twardowski for help.

Weeks, months and years had passed since the contract was signed. Master Twardowski, however, did not even think about going to Rome. So the Devil was angry, and he kept thinking and thinking until he had an idea.

The Devil transformed himself into a peasant and visited Master Twardowski. He begged for help to heal his sick mother. Twardowski, of course, agreed to go with the peasant to a nearby inn where the sick woman was supposed to be waiting for them.

As soon as they passed through the doorway of the inn, the Devil transformed back to his proper form. He started to laugh loudly.

“I have you now, Twardowski! Your soul belongs to me! We’re in Rome, just as the contract says! That’s the name of this inn!”

Master Twardowski was shocked and did not know what to do. The Devil lifted him high above the ground, then high above the city. They were floating in the sky when Master Twardowski started to pray. As he prayed, the Devil’s powers weakened until finally, he couldn’t carry Twardowski anymore.

The Devil lost his powers as they were flying over the moon. Rumour has it that he dropped Master Twardowski there. The man fell and lives there still. He looks down and watches over his beloved country and its people, making sure they are well.

A long time ago, in a village not too far from a stream, a kind-hearted soldier was trudging down a dusty lane. His movements were slow as he had been walking the whole day. He would have loved nothing more than to eat a nice, hot meal. As he came across a quaint little house on the side of the road, he thought to himself, ‘The person who lives here must have some extra food to share with a hungry traveller like me; I think I’ll go and ask.’

And so the soldier walked up the cobbled path towards the wooden door, past the garden full of growing cabbages, potatoes, onions and carrots. Once he reached the front of the house, he raised his hand to knock when the door suddenly opened. On the other side stood an old man. His hands were on his hips and he had a frown on his face.

‘What do you want?’ said the old man, rudely. Still the soldier smiled at him.

‘Hello there, I am a soldier from a village not too far from here. I have come to you to ask if you have any food you would be able to spare.’

The old man looked the soldier up and down and replied very bluntly. ‘No. Now go away.’

The soldier was not put off by this – he smiled once again and nodded his head. ‘I see, I am only asking so I will have a few more ingredients for my stone soup, but I guess I will have to have it plain. Just as tasty though!’

The old man scrunched up his eyebrows. ‘Stone soup?’ he asked.

‘Yes sir,’ the soldier replied, ‘now if you’ll excuse me…’

The soldier walked to the middle of the path and hauled an iron cauldron from his belongings. Once he had filled it with water he began to build a fire under it. Then with great ceremony, he drew an ordinary-looking stone from a silk bag and gently dropped it into the water.

The old man watched all of this from his window, bewildered.

‘Stone soup?’ he asked himself. ‘Surely there is no such thing!’

And after a while of watching the soldier stir the water with a small stick, the old man walked out and asked the soldier, ‘What are you doing?’

The soldier took a sniff of the steam coming out of his pot and licked his lips in anticipation, ‘Ah, there’s nothing I like more than a tasty bit of stone soup.’ He then looked up at the old man, adding ‘Of course, stone soup with a bit of salt and pepper is hard to beat.’

Hesitantly, the old man went inside and returned with salt and pepper, slowly handing it over to the soldier.

‘Perfect!’ cried the soldier as he sprinkled them into the pot. He stirred it once more before looking over to the old man again, ‘But you know, I once tasted this amazing stone soup with cabbage.’

The old man then approached his cabbage plants and picked the ripest cabbage, handing it to the soldier.

‘Oh, how wonderful!’ the soldier exclaimed as he chopped the cabbage up and dropped it into the pot.

He took a deep sniff of the pot and said to the old man, ‘You know, this would be a soup fit for a king with a few carrots.’

The old man said thoughtfully, ‘I think I can find some carrots,’ and he went over to his carrots and picked a handful.

The soldier was delighted when he was presented with the carrots; he chopped them up and stirred the pot once again.

And so it went on. The old man began to grow delighted at the smell from the pot as he brought onions, potatoes, and beef and so on. The soldier himself also added things like mushrooms and barley from his own bag, until he declared the soup was ready.

The old man smiled at the soldier when he offered half of the soup to him.

‘Why don’t you come inside? I have some fresh bread brought straight from the bakery this morning that would taste delicious with the stone soup,’ he said kindly.

And so the old man and the soldier shared a wonderful meal together. The soldier brought out a carton of milk from his bag and together they shared that too. The old man agreed with the soldier that the soup was better than anything she had tasted before.

It wasn’t until the soldier had given him the silk bag containing the stone that the old man realised the truth. It was never the stone that had created the delicious soup. Rather, by working together and being generous, both he and the soldier had been able to create a scrumptious meal that they could share between them.

St John’s Night is the shortest night of the year. It is on this night that the legendary Fern Flower blooms somewhere in the forest. The golden flower, with its mysterious glowing centre, blooms for only one night until dawn. When the first rooster crows, the flower disappears and will not bloom again until the following year.

It is said that the path to the flower is protected by the trees and mystical creatures of the forest so that only the most courageous and noble young man might find it. The flower possesses the power to fulfil wishes, and whoever finds this flower will have all of his wishes granted; but he will not be allowed to share his wealth with others or he will lose everything.

*

Long ago, there was a young boy called Jack, but everybody in the village called him The Curious One because Jack always wanted things which appeared beyond the grasp of others. He did not care about things which he could get simply by reaching out his hand. Instead, he wanted things which required a great effort to obtain.

Once, when everybody in the village was sitting around the bonfire, the elder of the village told the story of the Fern Flower. The woman was very old and had travelled all over the world and seen many strange things, so Jack listened to the story very carefully.

The young boy was fascinated and promised himself then and there that he would find the flower and make all of his wishes come true. It did not matter that the Fern Flower bloomed only once a year. If Jack did not find the flower on the first year, then he would keep looking year after year.

When St John’s Night finally arrived, Jack dressed in his best clothes and went into the forest to seek out the mythical flower. Jack knew the paths and the trees of the forest very well, but on this night he did not recognise a single thing. The trees appeared much taller, and their branches and trunks stretched out in such a way that he could not always walk around them. The bushes were thicker and spikier, and the pathways were all darker and scarier.

Jack kept walking despite all of the obstacles in his way – despite the darkness and the terrifying blue, red, yellow and green eyes watching from the darkness. Jack walked on because he knew that the strangeness of the forest, and the scary eyes in the darkness, were all there to prevent him from finding the mythical Fern Flower.

The pine trees were tall and wide and caused Jack to make very slow progress. The bushes were so thick that he had to hack at them with his hands and feet in order to continue on his journey.

Then he came across a pine tree that was so tall it seemed to stretch up into the sky, and so wide it seemed to him as if it would take forever to walk around its trunk. When eventually he had gotten to the other side of the tree, he noticed that it was not so tall and wide after all, but rather another trick of the mysterious forest.

Some time later, Jack came across a marsh in the middle of the gloomiest, dampest part of the forest. There was no way around the marsh, and when Jack tried to put his foot into the water he almost sank to the bottom. Eventually the young boy noticed very small clumps of grass dotted here and there across the length of the marsh. He decided that this was the only way to cross the boggy water, so he took a deep breath and jumped from one clump to the next until he had crossed over to the other side.



Jack continued on his winding journey through the forest until he came across a massive fern in the middle of a clearing. He noticed a tiny, radiant flower growing on a leaf of the fern. Jack had never seen anything so beautiful. The flower had five golden petals, and in its centre something like an eye that flickered and glowed against the darkness of the night. Jack also thought he heard the distant sound of laughter, but told himself that it was just another trick of the forest.

He reached out very slowly, but just as he was about to touch the flower, the rooster crowed and there was a bright flash of light and the flower disappeared.

In the darkness Jack fell asleep, and the next time he awoke his mother was standing over him and he noticed that he was lying in his own bed. Jack’s mother looked very worried and explained how she had found him asleep in the middle of the forest that morning.

The young boy felt ashamed that he had failed, but he never told his mother or his friends what he had been doing in the forest that night because he was afraid they would not believe him. Instead, Jack made a silent promise to himself that he would try again the following year.

Jack thought about the flower all year long until St John’s Night finally arrived again. As the villagers gathered around the fires, he dressed in his best clothes and went into the dark forest in search of the flower. This time the trees were even wider and taller. There were huge, slippery stones on the forest floor, and thick ferns, some much taller than the young boy. Once again, the strange eyes looked at him from out of the darkness, but Jack continued on his search.

After many hours, he saw something glowing in the distance. As he got closer he knew that it was the same flower with its five golden petals and the amazing glowing eye at its centre.

Jack approached the flower in awe, but before he managed to touch it, the rooster crowed and the flower disappeared just as before. Jack was so tired after his adventure that he instantly fell fast asleep and experienced a strange dream in which the eye of the flower looked right at him. The flower asked the young boy, ‘Are you ready to give up yet?’

When eventually he awoke from the dream, he promised himself that next St John’s Night, the flower would be his for certain.

The year passed very slowly, but eventually St John’s Night arrived, and again Jack dressed in his best clothes and set off into the forest.



This time the forest looked normal, just like it did in the daytime. Jack looked for the flower but could not find it anywhere. Then, quite suddenly, he noticed it, right there at his feet: the flower with five golden petals and the mysterious, glowing eye at its centre. Jack reached out and finally touched the mythical flower before the rooster could crow.

The flower burnt his fingers as if the petals were on fire! But Jack did not let go. As he put the flower inside his jacket, he heard a quiet voice say to him: ‘Now you can have anything in the world you have ever wanted, but you may never share your happiness with another soul.’

But Jack was too excited to hear the words of warning as he felt the flower laying down its delicate roots into his young heart. The Fern Flower was finally his, and he was going to have his every wish fulfilled.

*

When Jack reached the edge of the forest he should have been able to see his cottage, but instead he saw a palace in the middle of a large kingdom. This was something Jack had always wished for: to live in a palace and be ruler of his own kingdom. But there was also a carriage with six white horses waiting to take him to his new palace.

There were many servants inside the palace, but his family and friends were not there, nor anybody from his old village on the edge of the forest.

The young boy had a very comfortable bed and mountains of gold in the vaults of his palace. He often thought that he might send some of this gold to his family, but then he would remember how it was forbidden for him to share any of his wealth and happiness with another soul, even his family. If he did this, then everything would disappear and he would be poor again. And so the young boy decided that he must keep everything for himself, and if anybody else ever needed anything then they would just have to search for the Fern Flower as he had done.

Jack lived what many would call a happy life, but although the young boy had everything his heart desired, he was very bored and so became a cruel and wicked king who treated his subjects unfairly.

One day, he decided to take the carriage and visit his old village because he missed his mother very much. When he arrived at the little cottage on the edge of the forest, Jack’s mother observed the six white horses with fear in her eyes. He stepped down from the carriage with open arms but his mother did not recognise him. She said, ‘My son Jack is dead. If he were alive he would never leave his family. If he ever found the Fern Flower he would not keep such wealth and happiness for himself. He would share it with his family and friends.’

Jack wanted to show his mother how much he longed to share everything he had with her, but each time he reached for the gold in his pocket he remembered that he would lose everything if he were to share with others.

With this realisation, Jack’s heart turned to stone and he ordered his carriage to take him back to the palace.

*

Upon his return, he ordered his subjects and his servants to entertain him. He got drunk on wine and tried to forget about his old life in the little village. But no matter what he did, Jack could never forget the look of sadness on his mother’s face.

One year later, Jack decided to visit his family again. This time, when the carriage pulled up outside of his home, his mother did not come out to greet him. Instead, his brother approached the carriage. When Jack asked about his mother, his brother told him that she was very ill and that his father had gone.

Jack entered the cottage and saw his mother laid out on her tiny, uncomfortable bed. She looked very sick and could not even sit up to face her son. Jack felt a great guilt and fear come over him. He could not stand the thought of losing his mother. He wanted to reach into his pocket for the gold that might help his family, but again he remembered that he would lose everything if he were to share his wealth with others.

‘My mother is old and will not suffer for long,’ he reasoned. ‘I am young, and if I give up everything now I will suffer for many years.’

Jack turned his back on his family and returned to the palace. But as hard as the young boy tried to forget his family, he was haunted by images of his sick mother and his poor brother. He tried to ignore his feelings but was unable to enjoy his wealth or his beautiful palace.

*

It was during these long, lonely nights in the palace that Jack realised how useless his wealth really was if he could not share it with friends and family.

As time went by, Jack lost weight and his health became very poor. He was always miserable and his vast wealth no longer seemed to matter.

The young man awoke one day and knew that he must return home to his family and his friends. He ordered his carriage to take him right away to his old house in the village on the edge of the forest. But when Jack arrived back at his old home, nobody came out to greet him.

Jack stepped down from the carriage and approached the little cottage. He looked through a tiny window, hoping to see his family inside, but the cottage was empty.

It was then that an old beggar approached Jack and told him, ‘Nobody lives in that cottage anymore. They all died of disease and hunger, for they were too poor to buy food and were unable to send for a doctor.’

Jack began to cry over the loss of his family. He was the boy who could have anything he wished for, but what good was that if he did not have his family or friends around to share in his happiness? Jack wished he was dead because he could not bear the thought of being alone any longer.

Suddenly the ground opened up beneath his feet and Jack vanished into the darkness below, the mythical Fern Flower still clinging to his cold heart after fulfilling the young boy’s final wish.

The Fern Flower has never been found by another, and Jack, the young boy whom the villagers once called The Curious One, has never been seen again.

Long ago, a young boy named Lutek lived in Warsaw. He was a shoemaker, and he worked in one of the factories in the Old Town. Lutek was penniless and lived on what he managed to earn from the foreman.

In the evenings, Lutek often sat at the inn and listened to the exciting stories of older residents. He liked the tales so much that he often imagined being a brave warrior on the battlefield or a wealthy merchant travelling across distant lands. One evening, he heard the quiet conversations of the masters.

“Apparently on Tamka Street, in the basement of the Ostrogski Castle, there is a golden duck.” Master Jan whispered mysteriously.

“I heard that it is a beautiful bird, but also very crafty and dangerous,” Master Bartłomiej added.

“Why is it dangerous? How can a duck be dangerous?” others asked.

“Looking for the duck can get you lost in an underground basement. You might never return to the surface. They say that many have already tried and never returned,” Master Jan replied.

“What if someone meets the duck?” asked young Staś. He was the son of one of the masters.

“Then the duck will make him rich forever,” replied the masters.

Lutek heard these words and immediately ran out of the inn. He headed straight to Tamka Street. He reached the castle and found the entrance to the underground basement. It was dark, cold and damp.

The boy walked the corridors for a long time. At first, he was looking for the duck and then looking for the way back. He was so tired and cold that he lost all hope of returning home.

Eventually, Lutek found himself in a large chamber with a high vault, decorated with gold. Within the vault, there was a beautiful blue lake on which swam the golden duck.

“Hello, Lutek,” she said in a human voice. “You found me, so you deserve the prize. I will make you rich. Take this pouch; there are one hundred golden ducats inside. Buy whatever you want, but you have to spend it all in one day, and you cannot share it with anyone. If you do not meet these conditions, you will remain poor forever.”

Lutek grabbed the pouch and headed back. This time the corridors seemed brighter and easier to find, so he quickly got to the top.

Warsaw was waking up. Shops were slowly opening, and people were coming out to the streets.

“At last, I am rich!” thought Lutek. He ran towards the market. First, he bought all the delicacies he had ever wanted. Then he went to the tailor and dressed in the most expensive outfit. It was decorated with precious stones and gold, paired with leather shoes with golden spurs.

Then he went to the best restaurant and ordered the most expensive dishes to eat and the noblest honey water to drink. Many people introduced themselves and engaged in polite conversation. They were counting on a donation from such a rich young man. However, Lutek did not give anyone a penny.

In the afternoon, he bought the most magnificent horse. At the jeweller, he ordered a gold ring with the largest diamond. In the evening he went to the theatre, where he sat in the prince’s lodge.

As the evening grew dark, Lutek’s purse was still half full. The stores were slowly closing. Lutek was too full to eat any more. He wondered what else he could spend money on when he heard a voice:

“Noble sir, please help an old beggar. The war took everything I had.”

He looked around and saw the hunched figure of an old man in the shadows. The rags he was wearing had indeed once been a beautiful soldier’s uniform.

Lutek reached into his pocket and pulled out a handful of ducats. The moment he handed them to the beggar, a bright light shone right next to him.

He heard the voice of the golden duck: “You have not met my conditions! You will always be a poor shoemaker!”

Lutek looked at the happy old man.

“Good!” he said. “I could not live like that anyway, because I would never be truly happy. Money does not give you happiness unless you have someone to share it with.”

Once upon a time, there was a beautiful jamun tree that grew by the side of a river. A monkey lived in this tree; a happy and generous monkey who loved to eat the sweet jamun fruit that grew in abundance on the branches of the tree.

One day, a hungry crocodile approached the monkey and asked, ‘May I try some of the fruit from your tree?’

The monkey agreed without hesitation and quickly threw some of the sweet fruit down to the hungry crocodile. The crocodile ate the dark berries and found that he liked them very much. And so he returned to the tree the following day and asked the monkey again if he might try some of the sweet fruit from the jamun tree. And once again the monkey agreed to share his fruit.

The crocodile returned to the tree each day for many weeks and soon the two animals became very good friends.

One day, the crocodile asked the monkey, ‘Might I have some of the fruit from your tree to take home to my wife?’

Because they were such good friends the monkey agreed to give the crocodile some fruit to take home. The crocodile thanked the monkey and took the sweet fruit home to his wife. But the wife was not a nice crocodile, she was a witch crocodile and she was forever scheming and plotting against the other animals of the forest.

‘Where did you get this lovely fruit?’ the wife asked her husband.

‘I have a dear friend,’ replied the crocodile, ‘a monkey who lives in the jamun tree on the other side of the river. He gives me the fruit each day.’

The wife – being a witch, and an evil witch at that – thought for a moment and then said to her husband, ‘If the monkey lives in the jamun tree and eats the sweet fruit all day long, then imagine how sweet his heart must taste! I want this monkey’s heart to eat and you will get it for me.’

‘I cannot imagine such a terrible thing!’ replied the husband crocodile. ‘The monkey is my friend and I do not want you to eat his heart!’

The cunning wife thought again and then replied, ‘I do not believe that you are getting this lovely fruit from a monkey. I think that you are seeing another crocodile behind my back, a pretty crocodile. You are cheating on me, I know it!’

The husband protested his innocence and grew very sad at his wife’s accusations. He decided that it was best to stay away from the monkey and the jamun tree in the hopes that his life would return to normal and his wife would forget all about her evil plan.

But the weeks passed slowly and the crocodile’s wife continued to accuse him of cheating on her even though she knew this not to be the truth.

‘I know that if there really was a monkey who lived in the jamun tree then you would help me catch him and eat his heart,’ she would say to her husband. ‘That is what you would do if you loved me.’

Eventually the poor crocodile was convinced to go and see the monkey and try to catch him so that his wife might eat his heart.

When he arrived at the tree the following evening he felt very guilty. The monkey looked down and asked, ‘Where have you been all these weeks, dear friend? I have missed you very much.’

The crocodile replied as his wife had instructed. ‘I have been arguing with my poor wife. She very much wants you to come to dinner so that she can thank you for the jamun fruit, but we live on the other side of the river. You cannot swim. If you try to cross the river, then you will surely drown and I certainly do not want that.’

‘But you can carry me on your back across the river,’ said the monkey. ‘That way I will be able to come to dinner and finally meet you wife.’

The crocodile agreed but he was very sad that he was tricking his friend. The monkey, not knowing his fate, jumped down from the jamun tree and climbed onto the crocodile’s back. Then the two friends slipped into the water and began to cross the river towards the crocodile’s home.

As he was swimming across the river, the crocodile realised that he was unable to trick the monkey.

‘I am not telling you the truth,’ said the crocodile. ‘My wife is an evil witch and she wants to eat your heart. I am very, very sorry.’

The monkey grew scared, but he was a clever monkey and so he replied very calmly, ‘Oh, why did you not tell me that before, dear friend? I have left my heart in the jamun tree. We must swim back and I will get my heart for your wife.’

The crocodile was quite surprised that the monkey was so willing to give up his heart, but he quickly turned around and swam back towards the riverbank.

As soon as they reached the jamun tree, the monkey jumped from the crocodile’s back and clambered up the tree as fast as he could until he reached the highest branch. When he was sure that he was safe, he looked down at the crocodile.

‘You are a silly crocodile. My heart is beating in my chest where it has always been beating and your evil wife will never have a chance to eat it! And we will never speak again because you betrayed me! Now go away!’

The crocodile had a great deal of time to reflect upon his actions as he swam home to his wife. He felt guilty and sad for betraying his friend and he regretted his actions very much.

As soon as he arrived home his wife asked, ‘Where is the monkey?’

‘I am afraid that the monkey tricked me and now he will never come down from his tree,’ replied the crocodile.

But the wife was not convinced by her husband’s story and she kicked him out of their home and told him never to return for as long as he lived.

The crocodile turned his back on his wife and began to swim down river, away from everything he had ever known. He was sad and lonely and he did not know where he was going, but he also knew that he had sealed his own fate the moment he betrayed his good friend the monkey.

‘This is what I deserve,’ thought the sad crocodile as he swam down river into a dark and gloomy night.

There was once a farmer who had two sons.

The older son was selfish and greedy, while the younger son was kind and generous.

When the farmer died, the older brother took all of his land for himself leaving the younger brother with nothing except a basket and a sharp knife with which he could cut firewood.

He would go into the forest and chop wood and sell it in exchange for a little rice in the marketplace.

He was poor. He had nothing.

One day, the young brother climbed through the forest to the top of the mountain. There he sat upon a rock gazing out towards the west where the sun was setting.

As he sat there all alone he felt a rush of air from above and he looked and there was a bright bird flying down towards him. It had a huge wingspan.

He felt the beating of air, the rush of air. Then it landed next to him.

‘Why do you sit here all alone?’

‘I am poor. I have nothing.’

‘Is this true or is this false?’

‘It is true, I am poor. I have nothing.’

‘Then climb on my back,’ said the mighty bird, ‘and I will carry you to the Island of the Sun.

There you may take one piece of gold before I bring you back.’

He climbed onto the back of the bird and the bird took off.

Away from the mountain the great bird flew.

Over the forest the great bird flew.

Over the waters the great bird flew.

To the Island of the Sun the great bird flew.

As the bird landed, the sun set behind the island which glittered brightly, and the boy took one piece of gold.

He put it in his basket and climbed onto the back of the great bird.

Away from the island the great bird flew.

Over the waters the great bird flew.

Over the forest the great bird flew.

Back to the mountain the great bird flew.

The young brother took that piece of gold and went down out of the forest, and there he bought a small piece of land.

There he reared pigs, cows, and a few hens.

He lived well. He worked hard.

But one day his older brother came.

‘Where did you find this wealth, this land?’

The young brother told him.

‘I want this. Give me that old basket and your knife.’

The older brother set off up through the forest. When he came to that mountain he sat upon a rock and waited.

After a while he felt a rush of air and a beating of wings was heard.

There, as he gazed towards the west, towards the setting sun, a bird appeared from its bright rays, beating its wings, coming closer.

It landed next to him.

‘Why do you sit here all alone?’

‘I am poor. I have nothing.’

‘Is this true or is this false?’

‘It is true, I am poor. I have nothing. I want gold!’

‘Climb on my back,’ said the great bird. ‘I will take you to the Island of the Sun. There you may take one piece of gold.’

Away from the mountain the great bird flew.

Over the forest the great bird flew.

Over the waters the great bird flew.

To the Island of the Sun the great bird flew.

As it landed, the sun set behind the island.

The older brother looked and saw sparkling gold everywhere. He picked up one piece and placed it in the basket.

‘The basket seems empty. I may as well take another.’

A second piece he placed in the basket, then a third.

He continued picking up the largest chunks of gold until the basket was completely full.

Then he turned. As he turned he saw that the bird had flown away and the sun was rising. He could not escape.

The young brother inherited his older brother’s land. He tended the land well and with love.

What he produced he shared with others of the community.

Once upon a time, a clever monkey lived in a tree that bore juicy, red rose apples. He was very happy. One fine day, a crocodile swam up to that tree and told the monkey that he had traveled a long distance and was in search of food as he was very hungry. The kind monkey offered him a few rose apples. The crocodile enjoyed them very much and asked the monkey whether he could come again for some more fruit. The generous monkey happily agreed.

The crocodile returned the next day. And the next. And the next one after that. Soon the two became very good friends. They discussed their lives, their friends and family, like all friends do. The crocodile told the monkey that he had a wife and that they lived on the other side of the river. So the kind monkey offered him some extra rose apples to take home to his wife. The crocodile’s wife loved the rose apples and made her husband promise to get her some every day.

Meanwhile, the friendship between the monkey and the crocodile deepened as they spent more and more time together. The crocodile’s wife started getting jealous. She wanted to put an end to this friendship. So she pretended that she could not believe that her husband could be friends with a monkey. Her husband tried to convince her that he and the monkey shared a true friendship. The crocodile’s wife thought to herself that if the monkey lived on a diet of rose monkeys, his flesh would be very sweet. So she asked the crocodile to invite the monkey to their house.

The crocodile was not happy about this. He tried to make the excuse that it would be difficult to get the monkey across the river. But his wife was determined to eat the monkey’s flesh. So she thought of a plan. One day, she pretended to be very ill and told the crocodile that the doctor said that she would only recover if she ate a monkey’s heart. If her husband wanted to save her life, he must bring her his friend’s heart.

The crocodile was aghast. He was in a dilemma. On the one hand, he loved his friend. On the other, he could not possibly let his wife die. The crocodile’s wife threatened him saying that if he did not get her the monkey’s heart, she would surely die.

So the crocodile went to the rose apple tree and invited the monkey to come home to meet his wife. He told the monkey that he could ride across the river on the crocodile’s back. The monkey happily agreed. As they reached the middle of the river, the crocodile began to sink. The frightened monkey asked him why he was doing that. The crocodile explained that he would have to kill the monkey to save his wife’s life. The clever monkey told him that he would gladly give up his heart to save the life of the crocodile’s wife, but he had left his heart behind in the rose apple tree. He asked the crocodile to make haste and turn back so that the monkey could go get his heart from the apple tree.

The silly crocodile quickly swam back to the rose apple tree. The monkey scampered up the tree to safety. He told the crocodile to tell his wicked wife that she had married the biggest fool in the world.

Moral: Don’t underestimate yourself. There are bigger fools in this world.

     A long time ago, much longer than most people can remember, elephants could fly! They had four enormous wings and they whizzed through the sky so fast that it amazed the other animals. But these big beasts were sometimes also stupid. But shhh… the other animals would keep quiet about it and never discuss it.
        Because the elephants were so strong and so fast, God decided to take their help. He could ride on these big beasts and they could help Him to put the finishing touches to the world. In a moment He could be in China and from there, within the blink of an eye, He could zoom off to Iceland! And these elephants were so strong that they pushed and pushed at mountains and icebergs, shifting them until everything in the world was perfect. For example, they helped God to put the Himalayas in India – and in Tanzania, they had Mount Kilimanjaro. By riding on these elephants, God sorted the whole world out and made it absolutely perfect.
        Once this big job had been completed, God told the elephants that they could have a permanent holiday. Uh… that is, until He had something else for them to do. Now the elephants did not have very much to do. Then do you know what happened?
        The elephants became idle and to pass their time, they talked about the old days. They talked about how strong they had been. They talked about how fast they were, and how God had favoured them. And the more they talked, the more they came to think that they were much, much better than all the other animals on Earth.
        They were definitely the most important!
        The elephants chattered idly to each other. ‘Look at that peacock,The elephants chattered idly to each other. ‘Look at that peacock,And they would always make sure to raise their voices high so that the little peacock could hear their mean words. And the poor peacock, who was kind and humble at heart, could not disagree with the elephants. He thought, ‘The elephants are right. I am small. My wings are not beautiful like those of the fairies and nor am I strong like the elephants.

        Stories from folklore and fairytales are not always kind, but we view them through a small window where nothing can get in or out. Mistakes are made and lessons learned and there is a moral to be learned. With fairytales as with real life, whether a story is kind or not depends on when you choose to stop reading. It is worth bearing that in mind here …

Some animals are more fortunate than others. The Tamaraw buffalo are strong, the Calamian deer have antlers to fight off predators and the crocodiles of the Agusan marsh are stealthy.

Many would say that birds are the most fortunate creatures of all. Turtle certainly thought so. He was unlike the others. While most turtles are grateful that their flippers mean they can swim in the sea, this turtle moaned that they were not wings. While most turtles know that their hard shells protect them from predators, this turtle felt only a weight on his back that meant he would never be light enough to take to the skies. Flying was all he talked about and he bored the other animals to tears by talking about it all of the time. When he wasn’t talking about flying, he was talking about himself. This particular turtle was not exactly good company.

‘You should be happy with what you’ve got,’ one of the elders told him after he had been on an especially long rant about flying. This elder was a wise and ancient beast with many scars upon his shell and many lines upon his face. The young turtles claimed this elder had once met Bathala, the caretaker of the earth. This had happened many, many years ago when Bathala had first created life. The wise elder would neither confirm nor deny this rumour, but Turtle did not care. All he cared about was flying.

Turtle’s obsession meant that he had few friends. He did not much care for the other turtles who just wanted to swim and eat. And he resented all of the birds because they could fly and he could not. But he knew that if he ever was going to fly, he would need a bird to help him. It was that or ask one of the Monsters of the Philippines, and he was smart enough to know not to interfere with them. The only creatures stupid enough to ask favours of the Aswangs and the Wakwaks were the humans, and those who asked were never seen again.

Instead, Turtle decided to ask a goose. This was long ago you understand, back in the days when animals asked each other questions. He knew that geese were very fussy birds. They were also not particularly bright, and so Turtle thought that he would have no problem getting one to help.

The goose that Turtle chose to approach was, at the time, heading off to meet her flock. She did not relish the thought of trying to teach a turtle how to fly – especially this turtle. It seemed like an awful lot of work.

‘My flock is migrating for the cold season and I am very busy,’ the goose told Turtle. This was partly true, but the goose also hoped to avoid hurting his feelings. After all, everybody knew that turtles could not fly no matter how determined they were.

‘I really don’t care about how busy you are,’ whined Turtle. ‘I want to fly and I want to fly now!’

It was obvious to the goose that the insistent turtle would not take no for an answer.

‘Let me first ask my flock,’ she said, knowing full well what they would say. She could have flown off then and there, but she had either a big heart or a small brain.

The response she got from her flock was just what she expected. The air filled with loud, derisive honks as the geese all laughed at Turtle’s ridiculous demand. Once the laughter had subsided, one goose who was more thoughtful than the others voiced an unconventional idea.

‘If two of us held a strong stick between us,’ he said, ‘then Turtle could hold on while we flew. He does have a strong beak and could surely hold the stick while in flight. He would have to be very careful,’ he added. ‘If he let go, even for a second, he would fall and he would be too heavy for us to catch.’

The goose didn’t fancy this idea very much and hoped that the thought of falling to the ground would be enough to put Turtle off the plan altogether. But, being a very selfish and single minded sort of creature, Turtle was determined to go ahead.

‘Well, just remember to hold on as tightly as you can and never let go,’ said the goose, ‘otherwise you will fall and we will not be able to save you. You look very heavy with that shell of yours.’

‘Yes, yes, of course,’ said Turtle, utterly distracted by his own excitement. He was too busy picturing himself flying with the geese to pay heed to any warnings. He was also busy thinking how jealous his friends would be when they saw him flying high up in the sky above their heads.

And so, with Turtle’s jaw clenched firmly down on the stick held between them, the two geese took off with a whooshing sound and a flapping of their powerful wings. Having never flown before, Turtle was amazed at the myriad of sights that stretched out below him as the geese soared up into the clear blue skies: the beautiful canopy of the jungle, the winding rivers.

Everything he saw only served to prove to Turtle that he had witnessed far too little of the world. But rather than being humbled by the amazing sights all around him, rather than simply enjoy the experience, selfish Turtle wanted to shout out to the animals below. He wanted to brag and boast about what he could see. And he especially wanted to shout down to all of those turtles who told him that he would never fly.

And that was when he opened his mouth.

Remember how I said that stories from folklore and fairytales are not always kind? Well now you see why. Our story ends with Turtle falling but we never see him land. Does he hit the ground? He should. That is how these things work. And if he does … well there is a moral to our story. Can you guess what that moral might be?

But this is folklore and fairytale – a strange place where anything is possible, where there are talking animals who do things they know they should not do. So, for the benefit of this story, maybe he never lands. And in that respect, if Turtle falls for an eternity, doesn’t that mean he’s flying after all?

One hot day, a thirsty crow flew all over the fields looking for water. For a long time, he could not find any. He felt very weak, almost lost all hope. Suddenly, he saw a water jug below the tree. He flew straight down to see if there was any water inside. Yes, he could see some water inside the jug!

The crow tried to push his head into the jug. Sadly, he found that the neck of the jug was too narrow. Then he tried to push the jug to tilt for the water to flow out, but the jug was too heavy.

The crow thought hard for a while. Then, looking around it, he saw some pebbles. He suddenly had a good idea. He started picking up the pebbles one by one, dropping each into the jug. As more and more pebbles filled the jug, the water level kept rising. Soon it was high enough for the crow to drink. His plan had worked!

Moral: Think and work hard, you may find solution to any problem.

        Once upon a time, there was a young man called Ma Liang. He was poor and kind and liked drawing so much that he drew pictures everywhere. One night, he dreamed that an old man gave him a magic paintbrush and asked him to use it to help poor people. When he woke up, he found the magic paintbrush on his desk.

From that day on, he used the paintbrush whenever poor people needed help. When he saw that people had no water to use in the fields, he drew a river and the river came to life. People could bring water from the river to the field to help their crops grow. When he saw the hard working farmers struggling to feed their families, he drew more food for them to eat. Soon, many people knew about the magic paintbrush and were very grateful to Ma Liang.
        But in the village, there lived a rich man who was mean and decided to steal the paintbrush from the young man so that he could use it to become even richer. So he sent his servants.

But the young man drew a sea first.

The rich man was angry and said," Why did you draw a sea? I want a golden mountain. Draw it quickly!"

So the young man drew a golden mountain which was far away from the sea.

The rich man said, "Draw a big ship quickly. I want to go there to gather gold."

The young man smiled quietly and drew a big ship. The rich man jumped into the ship and set off to find the gold but when the ship sailed to the middle of the sea, Ma Liang drew a large wave which destroyed the ship and the rich man was never seen in the village again.

After that, the young man lived with his family happily and used the magic paintbrush to help the poor people as the old man had asked him to do and the magic paintbrush was known and loved by everyone.

        There once was a beautiful princess called Maria who could solve any riddle. Maria was a striking girl who was clearly very beautiful and intelligent. However, it was plain to see how bored Maria had become with the predictable life of the royal court.

Princess Maria’s remarkable ability to decipher riddles became apparent seventeen years ago when she was just a small child. Back then, the jester would often entertain the court with brainteasers that he had learned during his travels with the town circus.

The jester had just returned to the court when he appeared with an exciting tale from such travels.

‘I have for you the greatest and most difficult riddle ever,’ proclaimed the proud jester that day. ‘And nobody but me has ever been able to solve it. I bring it to you from across the great sea, from a small island that plays host to an old beggar, you see. This beggar told everyone he came across that he would not ask for a dime, “Just answer me this,” he would say, “and you will be on your way in no time.”’

The jester mimicked the old beggar’s voice with a smile upon his face as he repeated the riddle to those assembled at court…

‘I am as large as a castle, yet lighter than air

One hundred men and their horses cannot move me

What am I?’

The court filled with indistinguishable whispers, then slowly hushed into chin-stroking meditation.

To this day the riddle causes the same reaction wherever it is told. On the island where the beggar lived, everyone who heard it was so baffled that nobody could ever fathom an answer. Each time it was told and unsolved, he or she would give the beggar a coin from their pockets. This went on for so long that the beggar soon made a fortune and became the richest man on the island. Many people considered the beggar to be a crook, declaring that the old man had written a riddle with no answer so as to outwit the islanders. But the jester insisted that he had solved the riddle and that he was the only one to ever have done so.

‘The trick to solving the riddle,’ said the jester to the court, ‘is not to overthink it.’

When it was clear that not one single lord in the court was able to answer the riddle, the jester puffed out his chest and proclaimed: ‘The correct answer is …’

‘The castle’s shadow!’ interrupted young Princess Maria.

All those gathered in court that day turned to the princess and gasped in awe. Little Maria continued to play with her dollshouse, completely unaware of the shock she had caused. The court erupted into laughter and applause and the jester, most shocked that the child had solved his riddle, turned pinker than the little princess’s dress, running out of the court in a huff.



Needless to say, the jester was not a great fan of the princess from that day forward; he resented her for stealing his thunder and making him look silly in front of the entire court.

Word of the princess’s talents spread throughout the kingdom to the most distant lands, and soon after she celebrated her twentieth birthday, the king was keen to find his daughter a suitor, of which there were many.

The trouble was that Maria found most of the dukes, lords, and noblemen very tiresome indeed. Above all, she found them predictable.

One day, Maria told her father, ‘I want to marry someone who I truly love. I will only agree to marry the man who can pose a riddle I cannot answer.’

Maria explained to her father that such a man would brighten her world by adding the element of surprise and excitement. ‘He would truly win my heart with his brains and his keen nature,’ said the young princess.

And so the challenge was set. And a challenge it was, for any suitor who posed a riddle that the princess was able to answer, would be locked up in the castle dungeons. The king reasoned that such a challenge would befit only the best and most determined of suitors.

Over time, news of the challenge reached far and wide; even to a forgotten corner of the kingdom where there lived a peasant boy called Manuel.

The young peasant was very keen on challenges, and as he had always been intrigued by the princess, he decided to travel to the castle to pose a riddle and win her heart.

The townspeople thought that Manuel was crazy, everyone knew that the king’s dungeon was filling up with a trail of distinguished men who had failed their quest to find an impossible riddle for the princess.  They admired his courage, but all were convinced that the young man would end up in the dungeon like so many before him.

Manuel paid no heed to the townspeople. He was too interested in meeting the beautiful princess, and he was also fascinated by her boredom and could not understand how a person could be so disinterested when there was so much beauty in the world. It did not matter to the young peasant that he had no riddle to pose to the princess, he simply set off on his journey, confident that he would think of something along the way.

Manuel travelled for such a distance that time lost all meaning. Although the journey was arduous, so as it might break even the strongest man’s spirit, Manuel walked on blissfully, encountering beauty and intrigue with every step. He was so overwhelmed by the symphony of the mighty rivers, the songs of the woodland creatures, and the whistling wind in the trees all around. He played hide and seek with the animals whose paths he crossed, and he always stopped to notice how every sunset was different from the last.

The closer Manuel got to the castle, the less he understood the princess. He felt sorry for a person who could not be astonished by the world, by all of its beauty and wonder. He could not see how anybody could be bored in such a world.

The castle soon appeared on the horizon and still Manuel had no riddle for the princess. But something very strange happened that evening when the young peasant sat down to cook his dinner of wild boar. As he carved open the animal’s belly, he noticed that there was a frog inside!

‘Boars don’t eat frogs,’ thought Manuel. And no sooner had this thought occurred than the frog leapt out of the boar’s belly and hopped away into the forest. Manuel found this very funny indeed. He laughed and laughed to himself, and he didn’t stop laughing until he realised that he could use this strange occurrence to form a riddle for the princess.

Once he arrived at the castle the following day, Manuel was allowed time to eat and rest. He was given fine garments to wear and then taken to the princess’s quarters to be introduced. She was even more beautiful and exceptional than he had predicted, and her apathetic but endearing greeting left Manuel dumbstruck. The young peasant wished to all the heavens that she would not be able to answer his riddle as he wanted desperately to spend as much time with her as possible, maybe even marry her!

Manuel stepped forward, summoning all of his confidence, and delivered his riddle to Princess Maria.

‘I settled your hunger but failed to settle my own

Supper hopped away in a race

Too late for a belly to croak or moan

At this strange case

What am I?’

Princess Maria was speechless. She simply could not work out that the young Manuel was talking about the frog he had seen the previous night. Her mind went rushing to and fro. It was the first time ever that Maria was not able answer a riddle right away, yet she refused to be made a fool of by this bold simpleton, much less marry him!

The princess said to Manuel, ‘Thank you for your riddle, kind sir. Let me invite you to stay at our castle for three moons so that I may ponder on this great question.’

Manuel had nothing against enjoying the luxury afforded by his royal host and readily accepted the offer, confident that no number of moons would grant the princess knowledge of the strange happening that he had witnessed on his journey.

The princess knew right away that she would not be able to answer the riddle, and so she decided she would have to come up with a plan in order to outsmart Manuel.

It did not take Maria long to come up with such a plan. She was, after all, a princess of great wit.

Maria had her most beautiful lady-in-waiting sent to Manuel’s room. Her name was Lidia and she was given the task of making Manuel fall in love with her and trick him into telling her the answer to his riddle.

‘That way,’ reasoned Princess Maria, ‘not only will it seem as if I solved the riddle in only three moons, but Manuel will lose interest in marrying me because he will be too distracted by Lidia.’

But despite her best efforts to please him, Manuel took little interest in Lidia. He did enjoy her company and the wine she offered him, but he could not stop thinking about Princess Maria. He was not anxious for the days to pass, as he was sure that he and the princess could learn a great deal from one another. In fact, Manuel was convinced that they would make a fine couple indeed.

When Lidia returned with no answer to the riddle, Maria was distraught. The very next evening she sent a second lady-in-waiting whose name was Carmen. And this time she also sent a stronger blend of wine. But Carmen also returned without the answer to the riddle.

On the third night, the princess decided to send her final lady-in waiting, Rosa. But before Rosa arrived at Manuel’s door, the old jester appeared and said to the young man, ‘Are you really so pure that you cannot see the princess is trying to trick you, boy? Even though it is against the rules for you to have such visits, the princess is sending her ladies-in-waiting so that they might find out the answer to your riddle. Remember, boy, the princess is more cunning than she is wise.’

Although the innocent Manuel was surprised to hear this news, he did not change his attitude and received his third guest cheerfully that evening.

Rosa brought with her a book of poetry and a jug of strong wine. Manuel listened to the poems and drank a little of the wine, but he was not to be fooled. Before Rosa left that evening, Manuel gave her a false answer to his riddle, and he also kept the little book of poetry as proof of the princess’s deceitful behaviour.

‘If this is how she wishes to behave,’ thought Manuel, ‘than I shall beat the princess at her own game.’

On the final morning, the court gathered to witness yet another suitor sentenced to life imprisonment in the castle dungeons. Manuel stood alone in the centre of the court and waited until the princess arrived.

‘Your question has entertained my thoughts for three days now,’ said the princess in her best hoity voice, ‘and I am grateful to you for this. However, I am sorry to say that the answer to your riddle is clearly this … that strange things happen in nature and that on your travels you happened to come across a hare that had eaten a grasshopper. Therefore, the answer is … I am a grasshopper!’

Manuel smiled. ‘A great attempt, Princess,’ he said as he pulled Rosa’s poetry book from his pocket. But I do believe somebody has given you the wrong answer.’

The princess’s eyebrows reached for the heavens and Rosa instantly fainted in shame, followed by Lidia and Carmen who also gave themselves away by fainting. The court was in uproar at what they correctly perceived to be a case of foul play against poor Manuel.

‘Has the princess attempted to trick this young man?’ Came an accusing voice from the crowd.

‘Have you been sending your ladies-in-waiting so that you might learn the answer to the riddle?’ shouted another.

But the kind-hearted Manuel soon calmed the crowd and addressed the princess once more. ‘Do not worry, Princess, I do not wish to marry you unless you share such a desire. Instead I shall pose you another riddle. If you answer it correctly, let us agree that I will go on my way and never bother you again. But if you fail to answer my second riddle, then you must free all of those whom you have imprisoned in your dungeons.’

Princess Maria was red with fury at the peasant’s nerve. He had already made a fool of her in front of the entire court, exposing her as a cheater; her only wish now was to have him taken away by her guards. Yet she had no choice but to agree to Manuel’s challenge. And at the same time there was a strange new feeling growing inside of the young princess, one which could only be described as admiration, perhaps even desire.

The young man spoke: ‘What can be swallowed but can also swallow you?’

Princess Maria knew the answer to this riddle almost immediately. The answer was ‘pride’. And pride was exactly what the princess was prepared to swallow.

Maria pretended that she did not know the answer. She pretended this so that Manuel would not leave the castle, and she at once ordered that all of her previous suitors be set free. Then she told Manuel that she did indeed share in his desire to marry.

Upon hearing this news, the entire court erupted into applause, clapping and cheering at the release of the prisoners and the impending marriage of their princess to such a worthy suitor.

You see, Princess Maria was wise enough to understand that Manuel could provide her with more wonder and surprise than she ever thought possible. And she knew that any man who was able to outwit her was certainly worthy of her love.

        Once upon a time, there was a beautiful princess who was bored with life at court.

As she was the king’s daughter, she couldn’t go and play with other children her age. She would watch them from the balcony outside her room.

As she played by herself on the balcony, she would dream of going on thousands of adventures beyond the castle walls.

One day, when she had grown up, the princess heard a song that the children were singing on the street outside the castle gardens.

‘The king will sleep and will not wake until the early morning of San Juan.’

This song surprised the princess so much that she called over to one of the little girls.

‘What are you singing?’ the princess asked.

‘It’s a story our mother tells us before we go to sleep,’ the little girl replied.

‘Please tell it to me,’ said the princess.

The little girl told her the story:

‘My mother says that there’s a king in a castle far away from here. He has been placed under a spell and spends the whole year sleeping. He only wakes up in the early morning of San Juan’s day. If no one waits beside his bed, he goes back to sleep until the next year. He will remain under the spell until he meets a princess and marries her.’

The princess was fascinated by this story. She asked how far away the mysterious castle was.

The little girl replied, ‘I don’t know, but my mother says that to get there, you have to wear out a pair of iron shoes.’

So the princess ordered that a pair of iron shoes would be made for her. She insisted that they be beautiful yet tough.

When she received the shoes, she put them on and walked to a magical forest that no man had ever dared to enter.

A kind old woman appeared in a clearing and asked where she was going.

The princess replied, ‘I’m looking for the palace of the sleeping king who won’t wake up until the early morning of San Juan. Do you know where it is?’

The old woman didn’t know anything about that place, but she suggested that her child, the sun, could help.

‘But be careful. I worry you may come to harm when you see him. He’s very grumpy,’ the old woman warned.

In spite of the warning, the princess insisted on going home with the old woman.

Despite her bravery, when she heard the sun approach the house, the princess was frightened and she hid in a wardrobe.

The sun cried out, ‘I smell a human and I want some!’

‘Quiet!’ said his mother. ‘There is a poor young girl here. She is looking for the castle that belongs to the sleeping king who will not wake until the early morning of San Juan. I thought you might know how to help her.’

‘I’ve never heard anyone speak of the castle or the king. Although I think my sisters, the stars, would probably know about it,’ the sun replied.

Exhausted from her journey, the princess went straight to sleep without any dinner. She stretched out and slept on top of a table. Her hunger woke her the next morning.

The old woman prepared a delicious breakfast that the young princess devoured as the stars arrived one by one.

The stars were incredibly tired from their night of work. The princess asked every one of them about the story, but not one of them had heard of the sleeping king.

The stars suggested that the wind might know better. He was always going from place to place.

After breakfast, the princess went on her way again.

She soon met another old woman, who asked where she was going with those strange iron shoes on her feet.

‘I’m looking for the castle of the sleeping king who won’t wake until the early morning of San Juan,’ the princess said.

This old woman had no idea where the castle was either.

‘Maybe my son, the wind, can tell us where it is. But I worry that you may come to harm when you see him,’ the old woman warned.

In spite of the warning, the princess insisted on going home with the old woman.

Despite her bravery, the princess hid in a wardrobe when she heard the wind coming.

‘I smell a human and I want some!’ cried the wind.

‘Quiet!’ said his mother. ‘There is a poor young girl here. She is looking for the castle that belongs to the sleeping king who will not wake until the early morning of San Juan. I thought you might know how to help her.’

‘If she exits through the door on the other side of our house, she will arrive there,’ said the wind.

The princess went out the side door as the wind had said. After walking for a bit, she discovered that she was barefoot. The iron shoes had disintegrated.

Amazed, she looked up and saw a magnificent fortress and its entrance lay open.

She ran through all the rooms of the castle until she found the king. He was asleep in a luxurious bed. He looked kind, and he was in a very deep sleep.

Living the story was more wonderful than she had imagined. She sighed and settled herself by the headboard of his bed.

Days, months and seasons passed. The princess came to know everyone who lived in the fortress. They waited for the sleeping king to wake up but nothing happened.

Even though the princess was beginning to lose hope, she remained by the king’s bed.

One day, the princess heard sweet music. She had forgotten what day it was, but the town was celebrating San Juan’s day.

‘Let’s go on the balcony and listen to the music,’ said a servant girl.

The princess hesitated because she didn’t want the king to wake while she wasn’t by his side. However, she decided to go and listen to the first music she had heard in months.

Meanwhile, the king opened his eyes. The first person he saw was the servant girl. He thought she was the princess who had ended his sleep. When the real princess returned, the king admired her beauty, but the servant girl lied and claimed the princess was merely one of the king’s ladies-in-waiting.

Grateful for their care, the king promised a gift to both women. The princess asked for a rock and a branch of bitters. This strange request surprised the king, and so he followed the princess back to her room to see what she did with the objects.

He silently observed her through the doorway. The princess asked the rock to make sure the king did not forget her.

Then she clutched the bitters and was about to climb down through the window when the king stopped her.

‘Stop!’ he cried, ‘I know it was you who waited by my bed for such a long time and lifted the spell!’

When they looked at each other again, they fell in love. The two were married and lived happily ever after.

        Hundreds of years ago, beneath the royal castle of Wawel, there lay a cruel and menacing three-headed dragon named Smok Wawelski. He lived in a cold dark cave surrounded by bats and snakes who bore witness to the dragon’s villainous acts.

The nearby villagers always knew if Smok Wawelski was about to wreak havoc. They would hear the tremendous thundering of his mighty roar. As he soared over the villages in Krakow, his enormous wings blocked out the sun and cast massive shadows over the houses below.

Smok’s favourite wicked act was to breathe fire onto the villager’s farm animals, crops and the villagers themselves. He preferred his food to be smoked and crispy.

The trouble caused by the dragon was so bad that farmers started to keep their livestock inside at all times to make sure the animals did not become Smok’s next meal.

However, that meant that Smok swooped down upon the people themselves when they needed to go outside. And so Smok developed a taste for people.

Smok became evermore fussy about his meals. He would only calm down when the villagers sacrificed young women to satisfy his appetite.

As the dragon’s demands increased, every young woman for miles around disappeared. In the end, the only young woman left in Krakow was the king’s daughter, Wanda.

Of course, the king refused to give his beloved daughter up to the three-headed Smok. However, Wanda could not leave the country, and she was unable to step outside for fear of the dragon. It was then the king knew that the dreadful dragon must be slain.

The king’s guards travelled to every village in the country carrying this message:

Our cherished towns will bear no more destruction! There is but one solution — someone must step forth and slay Smok! He who saves our towns will marry the princess and later become king!

The eyes of each man in the crowd lit up with the thought of winning the princess’ heart and becoming the king. The challenge became the talk of the town.

However, the people underestimated the difficulty that lay ahead. Countless men who thought they would be excellent dragon slayers were brought down one by one by the creature’s colossal strength.

Little did the men know it, but their tactics were flawed. A knight’s metal armour would protect him from razor-sharp claws only to melt under a blast of scorching fire from Smok’s three heads. An archer’s arrows would allow him to stay far enough away from the fiery inferno, but they were never strong enough to damage Smok’s thick scales.

The country was devastated. The towns were desolate. The king grew desperate.

The whole country was in this sorry state when a young apprentice named Patryk arrived at the king’s gates. The boy was new to town and known to no one, but he had come to the castle with a courageous request. Patryk wore no armour and carried no weapon, but he did have a cunning plan.

The king listened closely to the boy’s plan, which involved nothing but a needle, thread, a dead lamb and sulphur. The king was in desperate need of a hero. He agreed that the boy could attempt what so many knights had failed to achieve.

That evening, the people of Wawel surrounded the boy’s small cottage and peered in through the window. First, they saw Patryk cut open the lamb’s body. He placed the sulphur inside and then sewed up the opening. One onlooker suggested that Patryk was to chase the dragon away with the horrid stench of sulphur. However, the alchemist, whose job it was to experiment with materials, argued that sulfur was explosive and, if eaten, would kill the dragon almost instantly!

As the sun crept into the sky on the following morning, Smok’s lair remained a dark spot in the deepest shadows of the mountains. A crowd of hopeful men and women waited in Wawel. They looked towards the mountains where Patryk climbed the one thousand steps to Smok’s lair.

The journey to the cave was long and steep. Patryk climbed steadily. He carried the lamb over his shoulder. A deep stream, as blue as the bright flowers growing on its banks, ran alongside the path. However, as Patryk followed the stream towards the summit, the darkness grew deeper, the ground was scorched, and the plants were blackened and dead.

As Patryk neared the mouth of the dragon’s lair, he lifted the lamb from his back and placed it near the entrance for Smok to smell it. He lit a small fire on the lamb and ran to the stream to hide in the water.

The ground quaked as Smok appeared from the dark. His tail swung from side to side. His heads turned in all directions. He was angry and hungry. The dragon’s eyes fell on the lamb. He leaned forward and took it in his teeth.

Patryk began to count down from ten as Smok swallowed the bait. The dragon looked pleased with his meal and turned to return to his lair. As Patryk counted ‘seven’, Smok’s stomach began to rumble. The dragon stumbled.

Patryk dived deep under the water as he counted ‘five’. He stayed underwater as he counted ‘four’, ‘three’, ‘two’ and ‘one’. As he reached ‘zero’, he broke the surface and took deep gulps of air.

Smok was no more.

The next day the people of the country celebrated Patryk’s triumph. The king proclaimed that Patryk was the smartest boy he had ever met and invited him to meet Princess Wanda. It was decided from then on that, to be a knight, one does not need only to be mighty with strength, but also with intellect.

If you were to visit Wawel cathedral today, you would find that Smok’s bones dangle from the gargoyles on the walls. Legend has it that a cave in the mountains is filled with bones and the gorgeous treasures Smok collected. It has never yet been found.

        Once upon a time, in a field not too far from you, there was an energetic and happy hare and a sleepy tortoise.

The happy hare was called Noel and the sleepy tortoise was called Archibald. Archibald the tortoise liked to sit and munch his dinner slowly, whilst Noel the hare would gobble up his dinner and run round and round Archibald until he was dizzy.

One day, they had an argument.

‘I am the fastest animal in the whole wide world,’ said Noel. ‘I’m faster than a cheeky cheetah, a kicking kangaroo and a racing rabbit,’ he boasted.

‘Oh do be quiet,’ sighed Archibald. ‘You are so full of yourself! If you’re not careful you’ll come to a sticky end.’

‘Where’s sticky end then?’ asked Noel. ‘Is it far from here?’

Archibald rolled his eyes and carried on munching on some tasty lettuce leaves.

‘Oh, you two do stop arguing,’ said a blackbird as he flew past.

‘No, this is serious,’ said Noel the hare. ‘I will prove to you all that I’m the fastest animal in the whole wide world!’

‘Ok,’ said Archibald the tortoise. ‘I’ll race you then!’

Noel the hare laughed his head off.

‘Just you wait and see,’ said Archibald. ‘I’ll get Wallace the wise old owl to organise a race for us.’

Wallace the wise old owl arranged the race for the next day. All the animals in the field put on their best clothes, groomed their fur, picked up a flag to wave and got ready to cheer the tortoise and the hare on.

‘On your marks! Get set! Go!’ called Wallace. And the race was off!

Slowly, slowly, Archibald the tortoise set off and quickly, quickly Noel the hare raced off and soon he was out of sight. In fact, he was so far ahead that, when he looked back, Archibald the tortoise was nowhere to be seen.

‘Gosh,’ Noel thought. ‘I’ve more or less won all ready! I think I’ll just have a little nap under this tree, it’s such a hot day.’ Noel the hare was soon fast asleep.

Meanwhile, Archibald the tortoise ambled along slowly, enjoying the sun on his shell. On and on and on and on and on he plodded and taking the odd nibble of grass from time to time. He plodded past the oak tree, he plodded past the bridge, he plodded past the cow shed, he even plodded past Noel the hare who was still snoring under the tree. Archibald plodded on until he came to the finishing line where Wallace the wise old owl and all the other animals in the field were gathered.

All the animals clustered around Archibald cheering and shouting.

‘Well done! Well done! You’re the winner!’

All the noise woke Noel the hare up with a start.

‘Oh my! Oh my! What’s going on? What’s all the noise? Never mind. I’d better finish the race then I can go and have my dinner,’ he thought.

Noel the hare raced off down the hill towards the finishing line. But when he got there, to his horror, he saw Archibald the tortoise with a gold winner’s medal around his neck.

‘This can’t be right! He must have cheated,’ cried Noel the hare. ‘Everyone knows I’m faster than him!’

‘Archibald the tortoise didn’t cheat,’ said Wallace the wise old owl. ‘He has won fair and square. Slowly and surely, never giving up, Archibald passed the finishing line first.’

Noel the hare looked very unhappy and sulky. Archibald the tortoise felt sorry for him and tried to cheer him up.

‘Cheer up Noel, it was only a race,’ Archibald said. ‘I’m sure you’ll win the next one. And I’d rather we were still friends than win every race under the sun.’

And from that day on, they became the best of friends and Noel the hare never boasted again.

        Hamelin was a beautiful town in Germany. The people who lived there were happy.

Then, one day, rats came to Hamelin in their hundreds!

There were brown rats, black rats and grey rats. There were small rats, large rats and giant rats.

“How dreadful!” said the people.

“How dreadful!” said the mayor.

“Do something!” demanded the people.

“But what?” the mayor asked. He didn’t know what to do.

Suddenly a man spoke up. “I am a rat catcher. I have a magic pipe, and the rats will follow me.”

“We will give you a thousand marks,” said the people.

“Five thousand marks,” said the mayor.

“A thousand marks is enough,” said the rat catcher.

The rat catcher began to play his magic pipe. He left Hamelin, and the rats left with him.

There were brown rats, black rats and grey rats. There were small rats, large rats and giant rats. They all followed the music.

They followed him right to the river’s edge, and then the rats fell into the River Weser.

Forty minutes later, the rat catcher was back in Hamelin.

“Thank you! Thank you!” said all the people.

“Thanks,” said the mayor.

The rat catcher said, “Give me my thousand marks.”

The people laughed. “A thousand marks? We’ll only give you a hundred.”

The mayor laughed. “A thousand marks? I’ll give you fifty.”

The rat catcher didn’t laugh. He began to play his magic pipe again. He left Hamelin.

Suddenly, behind the rat catcher, the children of Hamelin were dancing.

They danced away over the hills to a new land.

The children went to live in a beautiful land and were very happy.

However, their parents in Hamelin were not happy. Without their children, they were sad, very sad.

        Towards the end of the fourteenth century, China had begun to trade with many surrounding countries. Large fleets of ships set sail and brought back treasures from all over the globe.

Laden with gifts from the Ming Emperor, the Chinese made a powerful and favourable impression upon the rulers of surrounding countries.

Between 1405 and 1431, Admiral Cheng Ho made several voyages between China and the Indian Ocean. It was during one such voyage that Cheng Ho visited Borneo and learned of the fierce dragon that lived on top of the high mountain. The dragon was said to be the guardian of a very precious pink pearl.

When he returned to China, Cheng Ho told the Emperor about the Dragon of Kinabalu and the precious pearl. It was said that the dragon was very clever, and that many people had tried to steal the pearl but none had succeeded. The mountain itself was very high and the dragon lived right at the top, way above the clouds.

The Emperor met with all of his courtiers to discuss how they might solve the problem of obtaining the pink pearl. They studied all of the information supplied by Admiral Cheng Ho and eventually a fleet of more than ten ships set sail on the dangerous quest.

On board one of the ships were the Emperor’s two sons, Wee Ping and his younger brother Wee San. The brothers waved goodbye to their homeland and made for Borneo.

When the ships finally anchored off the coast of Sabah, the soldiers headed for shore using smaller boats. They looked splendid in their uniforms of reddish‐brown baggy trousers, brown boots and dark green shirts with frilly collars. Around their waists they wore bright green sashes, and each carried a heavy metal spear and wore a protective metal hat with a large brim.

There were also foot soldiers with bows and arrows who made special armour to protect the upper part of their body. All of the soldiers marched up the long, winding road to the summit of Mount Kinabalu on their quest to steal the pink pearl from the dragon.

From his lair atop the mountain, the dragon watched as the soldiers made their way towards him.

‘What a strange sight,’ he thought. ‘These men think that they can simply march up the mountain and take my precious pink pearl!’

Just as the soldiers marched over the final crest towards the summit of the mountain, the dragon drew in a very deep breath. The soldiers could not believe their eyes when the creature appeared before them. It had a huge purple and blue and green body, huge red and black eyes, and deep maroon talons as long as swords!

Before the soldiers knew what was happening, a great wall of fire shot out from the dragon’s mouth and threatened to burn them all! They turned immediately and ran back towards the mountainside, not wanting to be consumed by the flames.

The following day, Wee Ping and Wee San decided to accompany the soldiers to the top of the mountain, but the same thing happened once again: the fierce dragon appeared from out of nowhere, breathing a wall of fire that forced the soldiers back towards the small boats waiting in the harbour below.

Upon seeing the soldiers retreat is such haste, the dragon sat comfortably in his lair on top of the mountain and smiled to himself.

That evening, Wee Ping and Wee San tried to think of a way to outwit the dragon. ‘Surely’, thought Wee San, ‘there must be a time when the dragon leaves his mountaintop home in search of food.’

Wee San spent a very long time observing the surrounding countryside, and the following day he decided to climb a nearby mountain to see if he might get a better look at the dragon.

After climbing for some time, Wee San found himself walking through misty clouds that whirled about him. Eventually the clouds parted and he could see a large group of trees at the summit. The trees were very old with thick trunks and good sturdy branches. Their leaves protected Wee San from being seen by the dragon who was sitting in his lair on top of Mount Kinabalu. The dragon was looking below to see if any soldiers dared to approach his lair and try to steal his pearl.

After many hours, the dragon seemed to get restless. He got up from his vantage point and stretched his powerful legs. When he was satisfied there was no one around, he strolled away in search of food, leaving the pink pearl unguarded.

Wee San looked at the position of the sun in the sky so that he might be able to tell how long the dragon was away from his lair. He hoped that it would be enough time for the soldiers to march up the mountain the following day and steal the precious pearl while the dragon was searching for food once more.

This idea was quashed very quickly, when suddenly the dragon appeared on the opposite mountaintop.

‘He could not have been away from his lair for more than a couple of hours,’ thought Wee San. Disappointed, he climbed down from his position in the tree and made his way back to the soldiers in the harbour. But he decided to return the following day to check if the dragon always went in search of food at the same time.

Wee San climbed the same mountain for the next two days, always hiding in the trees so that he might spy on the dragon. In this way he learned that the dragon did indeed go in search of food at the same time, and that he was always away from his lair for a few hours each time. But this information did not bring any solace to Wee San who knew that his soldiers could not climb Mount Kinabalu in just a few hours. At that moment, a leaf from a nearby branch floated past Wee San and was carried on a gentle breeze towards the dragon sitting on top of Mount Kinabalu.

This gave Wee San an idea, and so the young prince hurried back down the mountainside to talk to the kite‐makers who lived in the village below. He asked them to make a very large kite with sails and a small platform at its base. He also instructed the kite-makers to attach a long rope so that the kite might be guided from the ground once launched.

The following day, Wee San and a small group of soldiers climbed the mountain towards the trees above, there they hid themselves and spied on the dragon atop Mount Kinabalu.

As soon as the dragon left his lair in search of food, Wee San stepped aboard the small platform fixed to the kite and the soldiers launched him into the air above.

The gentle winds carried Wee San and the kite towards the dragon’s lair on top of the neighbouring mountain, while the soldiers, far below, helped to guide the kite with the rope.

Wee San was soon floating above the dragon’s lair. When he was close enough, he reached down and took the pink pearl, replacing it with a Chinese lantern in the hopes of fooling the fierce dragon.

The soldiers pulled on the rope and the kite sailed back across the skies towards the safety of the trees.

As soon as he landed back on the mountaintop, Wee San and his soldiers returned to the boats in the harbour. Together with his older brother, Wee Ping, they rowed out to their great ships and set sail for home. The fleet was not far from shore when they heard the most terrible, thundering roar!

The dragon had not been fooled by the Chinese lantern and was crashing down the mountainside towards the sea. He was very angry; his eyes flared red and his long talons sliced through the trees at his feet. His teeth flashed in his huge mouth; his scales flashed in the sunlight all blues and angry purples. The dragon wanted to burn the ships and sink them to the bottom of the sea.

The fleet of ships was some distance from the shore but the dragon leapt into the water in pursuit. Wee San was ready for such an attack and ordered his soldiers to load the ship’s cannon. A single shot was fired towards the dragon just as he reared up from the waves, ready to unleash his deadly flames upon the fleet of ships.

The dragon saw the round, fiery object coming towards him and mistook it for his precious pink pearl. He thought the soldiers had relented and were returning what they had stolen from him, so he opened his mouth to catch it.

The dragon caught the red‐hot cannonball in his mouth and was killed immediately, sinking below the waves to the bottom of the ocean without a trace. The soldiers cheered for Wee San who had saved them all and obtained the Emperor’s pink, precious pearl.

During the voyage back to China, Wee Ping grew jealous of his younger brother’s victory. Although he did not show it, he did not like how the soldiers admired his brother, or how they talked of his bravery and his cunning. It was during these long nights hiding in his cabin, Wee Ping decided he would like to keep the pearl for himself and not share the victory with his brave younger brother. Wee Ping knew that his father would be unlikely to let him have the pearl once he heard about his brother’s bravery and cunning, so he hatched a plan to claim the victory for himself. Eventually the fleet arrived back home and Wee Ping and Wee San visited their father in order to present him with the precious pearl.

Just as Wee San was about to offer his father the pearl, Wee Ping stepped forward and claimed that it was he who had built a kite, and he was the one who had outwitted and killed the fierce dragon.

Wee San was very disappointed in his older brother, but he did not reveal the truth to his father as he did not wish to cause any trouble for the Emperor. Instead, he returned to his ship in the harbour and set sail during the north‐east monsoon.

Wee San allowed his ship to follow the winds because he did not care where they took him. So once again the winds returned Wee San’s ship to the island where it came to rest at the River Brunei.

When the Sultan learned of Wee San’s arrival, he sent his brother to welcome him. Gifts were exchanged, as was the custom of the time, and Wee San was made to feel very much at home.

Wee San became great friends with the Sultan and eventually asked permission to marry his daughter. The Sultan quickly consented because he had grown to love and respect Wee San.

The wedding day was a great celebration with much music and feasting.

Over the years, the Sultan became more and more aware of his son‐in‐law’s wisdom and courage. He felt that he could trust him with the future of the country and so he decided that when he died, Wee San – The Slayer of the Dragon of Kinabalu – would become the next Sultan of Brunei.

Wee San was honest in all of his dealings, and this honesty brought him happiness and respect. But his brother, Wee Ping, only brought sadness upon himself because of his lies and deceits.

    Once upon a time, there was an ant and an elephant who lived in the jungle. The elephant was a patient and kind animal, but the ant was not the same as his friend. The ant was forever making fun of the elephant, always telling him that he was too big, or that his nose was too long.

‘What do you need such a long nose for?’ the ant would ask with a wry smile. ‘Don’t you know that you look silly with such a long nose? And why are your ears so big and floppy? Don’t you know that no animal needs ears as big as that?’

On and on went the little ant, always teasing and being mean. The ant did not only tease the elephant; he teased the tiger about his stripes and the giraffe about her long neck. He teased the monkey about his tail and he even teased the beautiful bird about her feathers.

The tiger and the giraffe and the monkey and the bird were not nearly as patient as the kind elephant. Soon they grew so angry with the ant and his teasing that they refused to let the naughty creature anywhere near them.

‘I have had enough,’ said the tiger. ‘If I see that ant again I shall eat it!’

‘If I see it again I shall squash it!’ said the giraffe.

‘And if I see it again I shall hurl it from a very high tree!’ said the monkey.

The beautiful bird just flew away and refused to have anything to do with the naughty little ant ever again.

The ant soon learned to stay away from the animals in the jungle; all except for the patient elephant that is, because the elephant had yet to threaten the naughty little ant.

The ant did not realise how kind the elephant really was, and instead of being grateful he continued to tease the gentle giant.

He climbed up inside the elephant’s ear and began whispering such things as, ‘Why are you so big and slow, elephant? And why are your feet so silly and square?’

The elephant shook his head to try and get the naughty ant out of his ear, but the ant held on tightly and never once did he stop with his teasing.

The ant whispered to the elephant, ‘You are so old and you are so cumbersome and slow.’

By this time the elephant had had quite enough of the ant and his teasing. It was then that he finally lost his patience.

‘I may be slow, I may be old and I may have big floppy ears, but I can swim.’

‘And just what do you mean by that?’

The elephant did not answer. Instead he began a slow and steady march towards the river, down the riverbank, and straight into the water without another word.

‘No!’ cried the naughty little ant. ‘I cannot swim! I cannot swim!’

‘What kind of an animal cannot swim?’ asked the elephant, as he lifted his ears and plunged deeper into the water.

The naughty little ant was swept out of the elephant’s ear by the rushing water and carried away on the strong tide never to be seen again.

From that day to this, the tale of the naughty ant has been told to the young animals of the jungle before bedtime so that they learn never to tease friends or family or strangers.

‘Because,’ say the parents to their young, ‘you might end up being washed away down the river like the naughty little ant.’

        Once upon a time, there was a beautiful warrior called Chang’e who was married to a brave and strong archer named Houyi. The couple were both immortals who lived in the heavens, and both were well known for their brave acts of courage against many dangerous enemies.

One day, the Queen Mother of the West summoned Chang’e and Houyi to Earth because the Jade Emperor’s ten sons had turned themselves into orange balls of fire and were sitting in the sky above the Earth. The heat was too much for the Earth. Ten burning suns in the sky meant that it was never night-time, and the Earth never had a chance to cool.

Soon the earth dried up, the rivers turned to dust, crops turned to ash, and the lands became barren.

Houyi was a very skilled archer who never missed his target. And so the brave warrior aimed up into the burning sky, and with his bow and arrow he shot down nine of the suns from the sky. But Houyi left one sun to circle the Earth for evermore so that there would be both night and day.

The Jade Emperor was very angry with Chang’e and Houyi and banished them from the heavens for killing nine of his sons, even though he knew that they had done wrong.
And so Chang’e and Houyi had to begin a new life as mortals living on Earth.

It was not very long before Chang’e grew restless with her new life. She did not like living on Earth and missed the heavens and immortality. This restlessness soon turned to sadness, which then turned to anger at her banishment from the heavens.

Houyi felt guilty because he was the one who had used his bow and arrows to cast the Jade Emperor’s sons from the sky, and so he thought that it was his fault that Chang’e had been banished from the heavens.

One day, Houyi went to see the Queen Mother of the West.

‘What am I to do?’ He asked of the Queen. ‘It is my fault that Chang’e is now a mortal.’

The Queen Mother felt very sad for Houyi so she gave to him an elixir of immortality.

‘Whoever drinks this elixir,’ said the Queen Mother of the West, ‘will be granted eternal life. But there is only enough for one person,’ she warned, as she handed over the silver vial.

Houyi was very grateful to the Queen, but he knew that he could not give the elixir to Chang’e because he could not bear to be parted from her side. So Houyi hid the elixir from his wife and tried to make a happier life on Earth for them both.

But one day, Chang’e discovered the vial containing the elixir while her husband was away hunting. She was tired of living on Earth, tired of mortality and the simple life she was forced to live. And so Chang’e drank the elixir and was granted immortality. Suddenly her body became very light and drifted up into the sky. But instead of returning to the heavens, Chang’e came to rest on the moon, where she was quite alone except for the company of a small white rabbit.
Houyi was very angry when he returned home and discovered that Chang’e had taken the elixir and abandoned him on Earth to live alone. He raised his bow to the night sky and took aim at the moon, but he could not shoot the moon from the sky for fear that he would pierce the heart of his beloved wife.

So Houyi was forced to live alone on Earth where he hunted and taught archery to his students. It was not a happy life, and one day Houyi was killed by one of his own students who was known to be jealous of the warrior’s skill and bravery.

Chang’e achieved the immortality she wanted so desperately, but she remains to this day alone in her palace on the moon with only a white rabbit for company. She will forever be without her beloved husband, Houyi.

Each year, on the 15th of August, Chinese people bake Moon Cakes and look up at the night sky. If it is a clear night, it is said that Chang’e can be seen sitting alone in her palace on the moon with her only friend, the white rabbit.
